This project was inspired out of a curiosity for assessing __crime rates throughout Chicago’s various different neighborhoods__. Using __Tableau, R statistical analysis__, and the 2012 – 2016 crime data from Kaggle__, my team and I investigated the different types of crimes that occurred, the arrest rates, and the frequency and time of year they took place. This investigation covered 3 different techniques for analyzing the crime dataset: __exploratory graphs__ (dot plots, bar charts and treemaps), __time series__ (line plots and heat maps), and __geographical graphs__.


### Here is what we found out:

* __Crime Hot Spots:__ downtown, southside, and area between Oak Park and Downtown
* Overall crime in Chicago has __declined from 2012 to 2016__
* Top crime types committed were __theft and battery__
* __Recurring high crime rate__ during the __summer__ periond (June - August) every year
