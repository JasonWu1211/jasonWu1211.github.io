<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/recQualityPlot3.png">

The goal of this project was to develop a __collaborative-based anime recommender system__ capable of generating a __personalized list of unique and relevent anime recommendations__ based on database information comprising total user history and rating ID user feedback.The source of the data is from Kaggle.com [(Anime dataset from Kaggle)](https://www.kaggle.com/CooperUnion/anime-recommendations-database). There are two associated datasets, rating dataset and anime dataset. The rating dataset contains 7,813,737 Ratings (Rating scale: 1- 10) from 73,516 users on 12,294 anime with a density of 0.92%; the anime dataset consists of information about each anime with 7 columns (anime_id, name, genre, type, episodes, rating, and members). Using python with SUPRISE package and leveraging custom built data cleaning and model evaluation programs, I investigated different kinds of __collaborative filtering (CF) algorithms including item-based KNNWithMeans, SVD, Co-clustering, and SVDpp__.
