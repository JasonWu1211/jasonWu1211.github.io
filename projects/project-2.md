<img class="ui medium right floated rounded image" src="../images/featureimportance.PNG">

I tapped into my passion for __healthcare__ to explore a large dataset of medical appointment history, where I designed and ran a series of __data analysis experiments__ to understand why patients were missing their appointments. Moreover, I investigated and tested different __machine learning algorithms__ including Na√Øve Bayes, Ensemble (begging, boosting, and stacking), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the optimal predictive model for __capturing no-show patients__.
