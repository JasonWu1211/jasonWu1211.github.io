I tapped into my passion for healthcare to explore a large dataset of medical appointment history, where I designed and ran a series of data analysis experiments to understand why patients were missing their appointments. Moreover, I investigated and tested different machine learning algorithms including Na√Øve Bayes, Ensemble (begging, boosting, and stacking), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to determine the optimal predictive model for capturing no-show patients.
